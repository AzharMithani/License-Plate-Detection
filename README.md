# License-Plate-Recognition-System
Developed a License Plate Recognition system using Python &amp; OpenCV. It uses KNN algorithm to recognize the alphabets and digits of normalized font. Modules used numpy, cv2, os. The program takes an image of the license plate as input, Converts it to gray-scale giving a threshold of the image and finally extracts the plate area.

> Some of the Samples Images are as follows:
